                <h2>The Liberian Economy</h2>
                <img src="/home/jamesdjallahjr/Programming/index.jpeg" alt="A New Economy">

                <p>
                    The economy of Liberia is extremely underdeveloped, largely due to the First Liberian Civil War from 1989–96. Liberia itself is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until 1979, Liberia's economy was among the more developed and fastest-growing in Sub-Saharan Africa, but after the 1980 coup d'état, it declined, and the civil war destroyed much of Liberia's economy and infrastructure, especially the infrastructure in and around the nation's capital, Monrovia. The war also caused a brain drain and the loss of capital, as the civil war involved overthrowing the Americo-Liberian minority that ruled the country. Some have returned since 1997, but many have not. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, but poor in human capital, infrastructure, and stability, Liberia has a fairly typical profile for Sub-Saharan African economies – the majority of the population is reliant on subsistence agriculture, while exports are dominated by raw commodities such as rubber and iron ore. Local manufacturing, such as it exists, is mainly foreign-owned.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The democratically elected government, installed in August 1997, inherited massive international debts and currently relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depend on the implementation of sound macro- and microeconomic policies of the new government, including the encouragement of foreign investment.

                <h2>Liberia's Educational System</h2>

                <p>
                    MONROVIA (Reuters) - President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has branded Liberia’s education system “a mess” requiring a complete overhaul, days after all 25,000 high school students sitting state university entrance exams failed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    University authorities last week said not a single university applicant had achieved the minimum grade for admission, highlighting one of the many problems facing the country 10 years after the end of a devastating civil war.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The students’ failure did not come from the university, but rather from the schools that prepared them. The result is alarming,” Sirleaf said in a statement late on Wednesday. <mark>“It tells me that the educational system is a mess.</mark>”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sirleaf said problems had been identified during meetings with stakeholders and fixing them would require a complete overhaul of Liberia’s education system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Primary and secondary schools, like many of the country’s institutions, collapsed during Liberia’s intermittent 14-year civil war, which killed an estimated 250,000 people.

                <h2>Liberian Politics Affects the Communication System</h2>
                <img src="/home/jamesdjallahjr/Programming/politics.jpeg" alt="Liiberia's House of Legislation">
                <p>
                    The Politics of Liberia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic modeled on the government of the United States, whereby the President is the head of state and head of government; unlike the United States, however, Liberia is a unitary state as opposed to a federation and has a pluriform multi-party system rather than the two-party system that characterizes US politics. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the legislature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liberia is still in transition from dictatorship and civil war to democracy. Liberia's government is based on the American model of a republic with three equal branches of government, though in reality, the President of Liberia has usually been the dominant force in Liberian politics. Following the dissolution of the Republican Party in 1876, the True Whig Party dominated the Liberian government until the 1980 coup, eventually creating what was effectively a stable, one-party state, with little politics in the usual sense. The longest-serving president in Liberian history was William Tubman, serving from 1944 until his death in 1971. The shortest term was held by James Skivring Smith, who was interim president for all of two months in 1871. However, the political process from Liberia's founding in 1847, despite widespread corruption, was very stable until the end of the First Republic in 1980.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This situation changed abruptly in 1980, with the revolt against the Americo-Liberians and their True Whig Party. Currently,[when?] no party has majority control of the legislature.
