                <p>September comes from the Latin term septem, meaning seven, as it was originally the seventh month in the ancient Roman calendar - which until 153 BCE was originally ten months long. September depicted the celebration of Ludi Romani, which lasted several weeks and featured chariot races, gladiatorial contests and lots of feasts. Spiritually, September can be thought of as the month we celebrate our personal victories and accomplishments.
